<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Imagine a world where we aren't bound to the whims of a streaming service or digital </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">store;</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">a world where</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> our media is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">really</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ours, not just a license to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">be taken away</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at the whim of these services! Help me take back ownership of the games and movies we pay for!</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Disclaimer</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">is gonna</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> be a heavy </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opinion based</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> post with facts within the article</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, please</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> understand there is nothing wrong with disagreeing.</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is my opinion that</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> we as a community should attempt a digital detox from digital media services when we can and opt into physical methods.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">I am writing this call to action to reduce digital media and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to reduce subscription based</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> content. Let us go back to owning a copy, owning our media, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to where</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> no one can take it away.</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is right with digital?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I will not be the first to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">say,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that digital media is convenient</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, you</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> don't have to worry about the disk, cartridge, or whatever Nintendo may call it. So long as you remember your login </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">information</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you don't need to worry about losing your game/movies through hardware problems like water, scratches, or anything else </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">of that nature</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is because these streaming and gaming services have backups for backups so that you may be able to have access to games that they allow you to have. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> also saves on space with the clunky physical media. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> people would have bookshelves with games/movies, but now </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">not</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> so much. </span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is wrong with digital?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">most </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cases, the service </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that is</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> holding onto your digital media can decide to close down or remove that single piece of media </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">removing</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> your ability to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">access it again</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. I feel like the idea of us buying the product but then always having the risk of this product </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">being taken away</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> just because the distribution service is like, "na, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">you're not having</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> it anymore</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">".</span></p>
<h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Small Exceptions</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a very rare</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> case where even if the media </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is removed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> from the store, you can still redownload it as many times as you wish, with that rare case being steampowered.com. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GOG.com is another digital media source that also allows you to download and redownload the game if it's removed from their site</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> main difference between </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">steam</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and GOG is that if </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">steam</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> disappears, your games are gone. If GOG disappears your installer still works so long as you have the offline installer.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tho</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I don't agree with digital media, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">steam</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is doing it somewhat right </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">with GOG having future proof</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the issue.</span></p>
<h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It forces users </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to potentially pay more</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subscription based</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> services have been in play for a long time and are not new. However, there are 200+ </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">subscription based</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> services for movies and TV shows alone. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">common</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> services (Disney, Netflix, and Amazon) </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">for</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the "with ads" service </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">you</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are paying a total of 26.97$ a month just to watch what you want </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to watch</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tho</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> this may be cheap, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">keep in mind</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that once you no longer wish to pay for a subscription, you no longer have access to this media.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I have searched for TV shows like Summer Camp Island, Wolfboy and the Anything Factory, and The Dragon Prince. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">All of these are streaming services </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">exclusive OR bootleg purchasable. With</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> one no longer available in the US </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">anymore</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Personally, I want to support my movie and TV show creators but not as much as these subscription services </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are more than willing to just say, "No more of this content</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">".</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<h6 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But wait</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">...</span></h6>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before you say it, I understand that if Netflix comes out with </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">their Netflix</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> original and has a DVD version </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I am still supporting Netflix. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">however</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the idea that I outright </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">buying</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> physical media over paying for their subscription service shows my stance and what I like.</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A New Issue Arises</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nintendo officially confirmed on</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> April 2, 2025, that the Switch 2 cartridge will only contain authorization codes for the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">game,</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> not the game itself.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">is</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> very shaky grounds </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">on</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> what ownership you </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">really</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> have.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Originally</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you owned the game and were able to share it without monetary gain, then turned into you own a license of a game with restrictions as per the licensing agreement, and now </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">with</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the new setup for Nintendo, you are renting the game </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">now</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">and will</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> lose rights to them if/when they deem it necessary.</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do What You Can</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I noted that we should attempt to remove these services from our lives. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, I myself understand that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">its</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> very difficult to just stop all of these services. They are everywhere and in no hurry to stop. So what I want to do is avoid </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> if you can. Go for DVDs, Go for Disk games, Go for GOG and download offline! Do what you can, and if you </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cant</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, let it be known that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">your</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> not happy with </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">subscription based</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> services!</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">THIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> IS NOT A CALL TO PIRATE</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pirating has its place, but this is not one of them. I want you to support creators </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I want you to pay for these games. What this is a call for is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a call</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to avoid digital services when you can.</span></p>
<h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">My Opinion</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the title suggests, I want us all to take a step back and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">go back</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to DVDs, CDs, cartages even offline digital downloads. It may be clunky but at the same time, this is the only true way to have your game and keep it too.</span></p>

<p>1. I am disregarding my religious background when reviewing this series. </p>
<p>2. I am disregarding my political background when reviewing this series.</p>
<p>3. some spoilers are to be expected</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. this review is only in the context of all the episodes up to season 2 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">episode</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 12 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 4 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shorts listed within the helluva boss playlist, totaling 24 videos to watch. New reviews will come out as new episodes come out!</span></p>
<h1 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helluva Boss </span></h1>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The show is about</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 3 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">imps and a hellhound: Blitzo (the o is silent), Moxxie, Millie, and Loona! Blitzo got tired of being </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a basic</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> nobody and decided to start his own business.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">what is his business?</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">you might ask, hunting down and killing in any specified way that dammed souls may request/demand, and who do he and his business partners hunt? Humans on Earth!</span></p>
<h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Does Blitzo Get To Earth?</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Blitzo does a transaction, for lack of better words, with a powerful demon known as an ars goetia named Stolas. Stolas has a book with magical powers to open portals to the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">human world.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through this book, he is meant to study the stars and understand prophecies. However, through some</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">favors,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stolas is willing to give up his sacred book at risk of great punishment.</span></p>
<h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anything Else You Should Know?</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In almost every </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">episode</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> there can be bloody bodies, some form of killing, swearing, and a LOT of sexual jokes. They even show (tho blurred) dildos in 2 of the episodes. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This series is very crude, more so than Hazbin Hotel</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, so be warned</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Good</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This series is actually hilarious. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The writing is well done (to a point </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I will get to that), the characters are loveable, and, in a lot of aspects, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> relatable when it comes to their emotional issues. When watching the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">series</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you get to grow with and watch the characters progress in their emotional state, from the petty drama between Blitzo and Moxxie to the romantic married couple between Moxxie and Milly.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bad</span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right around late season 2, the story got shaky, facing similar issues as to Hazbin Hotel. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mostly</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the questionable pacing of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">characters'</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> emotional status. It is apparent that since the 2nd episode, Stolas did not have a good relationship with his daughter due to family issues. However, in the later episode of season 2, we have a major falling out that is caused by questionable reasons and felt very forced. A few other events took place as well </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> also feels like context is missing or out of order</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, more</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> info on that in my in-depth post (to be added).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I think one of the major flaws with this storyline is that at many points that it feel rushed. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> not nearly as bad as Hazbin Hotel, you start to notice it in episodes like season 1 episode 6 truth seekers. by no means a bad episode, but it felt like the flow could of been smoother as it felt like bits of the story were taken out due to keeping it within the appropriate time limit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lastly, we have very little Milly growth, now the writers tried to combat that with showing story about her and her family, but even then Milly feels like a flat character, for being one of the major characters in the series she has less growth then the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I say, I say!</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">salesmen.</span></p>
<h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Rating </span></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So of all the harshness I gave, this series is unmatched when compared to many other indie series or even standard TV shows</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, I</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> hope the writing gets better </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> this is just time constrained issue that we will not have in the future. As it sits right now, I am giving this series a 7/10. A major step above Hazbin, as it has incredible music and pretty good writing for most of the story. All the music is amazingly placed and works well with the story. I </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">just</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> hope that season 3 does not fall into the same pit holes as </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hazbin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Hotel.</span></p>

                <h3 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What Are MOBA Games?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you already know what MOBA games are, you can skip this whole post.</span></p>
<h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Game Function </span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena! In this game format, players are split between 2 teams in multiple lanes, commonly 3. The goal in these MOBA games is to "kill the keep." You have</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 5 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">players on each team with unlimited lives. However, if you die, you need to wait until you revive. As the game goes on, the timer gets longer and longer. Each game is limited to its own session; the last game session will not be transferred to the next game session.</span></p>
<h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shops and Items</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You also have a shop to get items and in turn get more stats. These stats can make or break your game </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">so</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you best get items that suit character.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"But how would you pay for these </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">items?" You</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> might ask; well </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">by</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> killing the enemy's troops/players/buildings, and you also obtain gold passively.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Items and their stats vary from game to game, deadlock has items that can modify your weapon's reload whereas League of Legends will not have such items.</span></p>
<h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is the goal of these games?</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You need to move into the enemy's base and destroy their keep, however, in most of these games, you will have to deal with enemy creatures known as minions, towers, and some form of buffing building!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Minions: </strong>The minions are simple creatures that are mainly there for you to earn gold once you kill them, they do a small amount of damage, but be careful, if you aggro too many of them then even a hero can't defend against them.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Towers: </strong>The towers are more of an equalizer </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">able</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to destroy the minions quickly, but the tower does not share the gold with you in most cases. The tower does serve as a protector, if you attack an enemy hero under their </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tower</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> then you will be targeted, so be mindful of that. You have to kill each tower within that lane to enter into the enemy's base.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Buffing Buildings: </strong>In the enemy's base, you have a buffing building that, once destroyed, can buff your ally minions. The buffs differ greatly per game but they are invaluable for your team! These buildings generally have no protection except for other players or minions. These buildings also serve an additional purpose, they are the main requirement to destroy before you can touch the keep.</span></p>
<p><strong>Keep: </strong>The Keep is the main building that you need to destroy, but unless you destroy most of the buildings above, you can't even touch the Keep. Most players tend to get items and multiple minions with them to destroy these keeps because they tend to have a defense system of some sort, generally following the same rules as towers.</p>
<h5 class="align-center">Why Are MOBAs So Popular?</h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These games tend to be fast-paced and requires a lot of teamwork and skill. People find these games enjoyable because of the competitiveness of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">game,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and the fact that the game is limitless. There is no endgame </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">with</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> each match not transferring over to the next.

<h1 class="align-center">Hazbin Hotel</h1>
<p>The show is about the princess of hell, Charlie, and how she wishes the best for her people, her people being the sinners from Earth. However due to claimed overpopulation reasons, heaven sends down an elite squad of angels to reduce the population of the sinners, before you ask, these angels use special weapons that destroy the soul making you cease to exist. Throughout the show we see Charlie pleading with heaven to put a halt to the killing of her people and instead provide a way to redeem themselves and enter into heaven. </p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Good</h4>
<p>The story gives sort of adult Disney vibes, something you should not show your kids but a 16-year-old would enjoy. There is fun music and enjoyable characters. I wish to say more but that is about it.</p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Bad</h4>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the story is an interesting idea and could be an amazing hit, and to a large fan base, it is a huge hit. But each time I rewatched this series I found more and more wrong with this story.</p>
<p>From simple continuity issues to questionable pacing, It feels like Hazbin Hotel struggles a fair bit with script writing errors.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">Continuity issues</h6>
<p>When Charlie has get her meeting in heaven she let the line "fuck yes" slip out, followed by people in heaven giving Charlie a sour look as if that word is not allowed. However, before and after the scene we have multiple people saying "fuck" in many parts of the episode. This is something I did over look in my original watch through, but then noticed on my 2nd run.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">Questionable Pacing</h6>
<p>An example of what I would call questionable pacing would be when VOX, the TV demon, finds out that Alister, the radio demon, is back. In the scene VOX is talking to one of the other demons he works with about an unrelated subject then the demon mentions how "the radio demon" is back in town. VOX responds with anger asking why the other demon did not say that first, the song did not start until after a few seconds of already knowing that Alister is back, VOX says again in a more angry tone "That Fucker is back" to kick off the song. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the song is a masterpiece, excellent work, audibly and story-wise this song is perfect. However, the placement in the TV show is horrendous and should be reviewed. Many songs are like this. Just spontaneous and haphazardly in as if the writer had these songs and just wanted to jam them in there. I think "Respectless" and "You Didn't Know" were some of the only songs that were amazingly placed, as both of these songs made sense with the scene and the events that were going on around it.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">It felt rushed</h6>
<p>In my personal opinion the series could have done well with season 1 being split between 2 seasons with extra story added in, with the season finale of season 1 being heaven saying screw you we are killing your people, and season 2 being heaven fighting and being defeated/succeeding over hell. With this, we would have extra content and the story would slow down quite a bit and not feel rushed.</p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Rating </h4>
<p>If you were to ask me on my first watch-through of this show, I would have given it a high score because it was thrilling to watch and had me captivated, the songs were amazing, and the characters were, and still are loveable. On the surface, I could understand the series as a whole. However, on my 2nd and 3rd watch throughs, I found more issues with the series, and finally, on my final watch-through, my review turned from a high rating to a low rating claiming that a lot of this was more eye candy than creative writing as the story failed to hold up continuity and the pacing was all over the place.</p>
