<h1 class="align-center">Hazbin Hotel</h1>
<p>The show is about the princess of hell, Charlie, and how she wishes the best for her people, her people being the sinners from Earth. However due to claimed overpopulation reasons, heaven sends down an elite squad of angels to reduce the population of the sinners, before you ask, these angels use special weapons that destroy the soul making you cease to exist. Throughout the show we see Charlie pleading with heaven to put a halt to the killing of her people and instead provide a way to redeem themselves and enter into heaven. </p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Good</h4>
<p>The story gives sort of adult Disney vibes, something you should not show your kids but a 16-year-old would enjoy. There is fun music and enjoyable characters. I wish to say more but that is about it.</p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Bad</h4>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the story is an interesting idea and could be an amazing hit, and to a large fan base, it is a huge hit. But each time I rewatched this series I found more and more wrong with this story.</p>
<p>From simple continuity issues to questionable pacing, It feels like Hazbin Hotel struggles a fair bit with script writing errors.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">Continuity issues</h6>
<p>When Charlie has get her meeting in heaven she let the line "fuck yes" slip out, followed by people in heaven giving Charlie a sour look as if that word is not allowed. However, before and after the scene we have multiple people saying "fuck" in many parts of the episode. This is something I did over look in my original watch through, but then noticed on my 2nd run.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">Questionable Pacing</h6>
<p>An example of what I would call questionable pacing would be when VOX, the TV demon, finds out that Alister, the radio demon, is back. In the scene VOX is talking to one of the other demons he works with about an unrelated subject then the demon mentions how "the radio demon" is back in town. VOX responds with anger asking why the other demon did not say that first, the song did not start until after a few seconds of already knowing that Alister is back, VOX says again in a more angry tone "That Fucker is back" to kick off the song. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the song is a masterpiece, excellent work, audibly and story-wise this song is perfect. However, the placement in the TV show is horrendous and should be reviewed. Many songs are like this. Just spontaneous and haphazardly in as if the writer had these songs and just wanted to jam them in there. I think "Respectless" and "You Didn't Know" were some of the only songs that were amazingly placed, as both of these songs made sense with the scene and the events that were going on around it.</p>
<h6 class="align-center">It felt rushed</h6>
<p>In my personal opinion the series could have done well with season 1 being split between 2 seasons with extra story added in, with the season finale of season 1 being heaven saying screw you we are killing your people, and season 2 being heaven fighting and being defeated/succeeding over hell. With this, we would have extra content and the story would slow down quite a bit and not feel rushed.</p>
<h4 class="align-center">The Rating </h4>
<p>If you were to ask me on my first watch-through of this show, I would have given it a high score because it was very fun to watch and very entertaining, the songs were amazing, and the characters were, and still are loveable. On the surface, I could understand the series as a whole. However, on my 2nd and 3rd watch throughs, I found more issues with the series, and finally, on my final watch-through, my review turned from a high rating to a low rating claiming that a lot of this was more eye candy than creative writing as the story failed to hold up continuity and the pacing was all over the place.</p>
