In this game format, players are split between 2 teams in multiple lanes, commonly 3. The goal in these MOBA games is to "kill the keep." You have</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 5 </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">players on each team with unlimited lives. However, if you die, you need to wait until you revive. As the game goes on, the timer gets longer and longer. Each game is limited to its own session; the last game session will not be transferred to the next game session.</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shops</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You also have a shop there to get items and intern get more stats. These stats can make or break your game </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">so</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you best get items that suit character.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"But how would you pay for these </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">items" you</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> might ask; well </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">by</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> killing the enemy's troops/players/buildings, and you also obtain gold passively.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Items and their stats vary from game to game, deadlock has items that can modify your weapon's reload whereas League of Legends will not have such items.</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is the goal of these games?</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You need to move into the enemy's base and destroy their keep, however, in most of these games, you will have to deal with enemy creatures known as minions, towers, and some form of buffing building!</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The minions are simple creatures that are mainly there for you to earn gold once you kill them, they do a small amount of damage, but be careful, if you aggro too many of them then even a hero can't defend against them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The towers are more of an equalizer </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">able</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to destroy the minions quickly, but the tower does not share the gold with you in most cases. The tower does serve as a protector, if you attack an enemy hero under their </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tower</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> then you will be targeted, so be mindful of that. You have to kill each tower within that lane to enter into the enemy's base.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the enemy's base, you have a buffing building that, once destroyed, can buff your ally minions. The buffs differ greatly per game </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">but</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> they are very helpful for your team! These buildings generally have no protection except for other players or minions.</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What makes MOBA games fun?</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These games tend to be fast-paced and requires a lot of teamwork and skill. People find these games enjoyable because of the competitiveness of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">game,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and the fact that the game is limitless. There is no endgame </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">with</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> each match not transferring over to the next. The main appeal of this game is the number of characters you can play, the number of builds you can go with each character, and the fact that you will play with different people the next time you play again.</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who are these games not for?</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solo </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">players,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and people who want to see progress. These games are amazing time wasters and provide you with little to no grand stats or achievements. If you are someone wanting to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">see</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a skill, a number, a quest, or anything go up, MOBA games are not for you. If are you wanting a semi-quick game then this is it!</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What MOBA games are out there?</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Traditional</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> MOBA games like League of Legends</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is a popular one</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, DOTA 2 is another good one, then you have some </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">non traditional</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> MOBA games like Deadlock and SMITE.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">full list will be provided and maintained when reviews for these games are made.</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 11, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/games/">Games</a></li><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/moba/">MOBA</a></li><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/quick-read/">quick read</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/authors/timothy-hill/" rel="author">Timothy Hill</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/hazbin-hotel.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://timothyhill46.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/hiuzbmpm-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="720" width="720"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Hazbin Hotel</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
