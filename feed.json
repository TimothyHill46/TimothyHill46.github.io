            "content_html": "<h3 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Are MOBA Games?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you already know what MOBA games are, you can skip this whole post.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Game Function </span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena! In this game format, players are split between 2 teams in multiple lanes, commonly 3. The goal in these MOBA games is to \"kill the keep.\" You have</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> 5 </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">players on each team with unlimited lives. However, if you die, you need to wait until you revive. As the game goes on, the timer gets longer and longer. Each game is limited to its own session; the last game session will not be transferred to the next game session.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shops</span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You also have a shop there to get items and intern get more stats. These stats can make or break your game </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">so</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> you best get items that suit character.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\"But how would you pay for these </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">items\" you</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> might ask; well </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">by</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> killing the enemy's troops/players/buildings, and you also obtain gold passively.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Items and their stats vary from game to game, deadlock has items that can modify your weapon's reload whereas League of Legends will not have such items.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the goal of these games?</span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to move into the enemy's base and destroy their keep, however, in most of these games, you will have to deal with enemy creatures known as minions, towers, and some form of buffing building!</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The minions are simple creatures that are mainly there for you to earn gold once you kill them, they do a small amount of damage, but be careful, if you aggro too many of them then even a hero can't defend against them.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The towers are more of an equalizer </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">able</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> to destroy the minions quickly, but the tower does not share the gold with you in most cases. The tower does serve as a protector, if you attack an enemy hero under their </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">tower</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> then you will be targeted, so be mindful of that. You have to kill each tower within that lane to enter into the enemy's base.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the enemy's base, you have a buffing building that, once destroyed, can buff your ally minions. The buffs differ greatly per game </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">but</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> they are very helpful for your team! These buildings generally have no protection except for other players or minions.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What makes MOBA games fun?</span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These games tend to be fast-paced and requires a lot of teamwork and skill. People find these games enjoyable because of the competitiveness of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">game,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and the fact that the game is limitless. There is no endgame </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">with</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> each match not transferring over to the next. The main appeal of this game is the number of characters you can play, the number of builds you can go with each character, and the fact that you will play with different people the next time you play again.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Who are these games not for?</span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solo </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">players,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and people who want to see progress. These games are amazing time wasters and provide you with little to no grand stats or achievements. If you are someone wanting to </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">see</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> a skill, a number, a quest, or anything go up, MOBA games are not for you. If are you wanting a semi-quick game then this is it!</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What MOBA games are out there?</span></h5>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Traditional</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> MOBA games like League of Legends</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is a popular one</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, DOTA 2 is another good one, then you have some </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">non traditional</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> MOBA games like Deadlock and SMITE.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> a </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">full list will be provided and maintained when reviews for these games are made.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<h2 class=\"align-center\">Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>1. I am disregarding my religious background when reviewing this series. </p>\n<p>2. I am disregarding my political background when reviewing this series.</p>\n<p>3. some spoilers are to be expected</p>\n<h1 class=\"align-center\">Hazbin Hotel</h1>\n<p>The show is about the princess of hell, Charlie, and how she wishes the best for her people, her people being the sinners from Earth. However due to claimed overpopulation reasons, heaven sends down an elite squad of angels to reduce the population of the sinners, before you ask, these angels use special weapons that destroy the soul making you cease to exist. Throughout the show we see Charlie pleading with heaven to put a halt to the killing of her people and instead provide a way to redeem themselves and enter into heaven. </p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\">The Good</h4>\n<p>The story gives sort of adult Disney vibes, something you should not show your kids but a 16-year-old would enjoy. There is fun music and enjoyable characters. I wish to say more but that is about it.</p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\">The Bad</h4>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, the story is an interesting idea and could be an amazing hit, and to a large fan base, it is a huge hit. But each time I rewatched this series I found more and more wrong with this story.</p>\n<p>From simple continuity issues to questionable pacing, It feels like Hazbin Hotel struggles a fair bit with script writing errors.</p>\n<h6 class=\"align-center\">Continuity issues</h6>\n<p>When Charlie has get her meeting in heaven she let the line \"fuck yes\" slip out, followed by people in heaven giving Charlie a sour look as if that word is not allowed. However, before and after the scene we have multiple people saying \"fuck\" in many parts of the episode. This is something I did over look in my original watch through, but then noticed on my 2nd run.</p>\n<h6 class=\"align-center\">Questionable Pacing</h6>\n<p>An example of what I would call questionable pacing would be when VOX, the TV demon, finds out that Alister, the radio demon, is back. In the scene VOX is talking to one of the other demons he works with about an unrelated subject then the demon mentions how \"the radio demon\" is back in town. VOX responds with anger asking why the other demon did not say that first, the song did not start until after a few seconds of already knowing that Alister is back, VOX says again in a more angry tone \"That Fucker is back\" to kick off the song. </p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, the song is a masterpiece, excellent work, audibly and story-wise this song is perfect. However, the placement in the TV show is horrendous and should be reviewed. Many songs are like this. Just spontaneous and haphazardly in as if the writer had these songs and just wanted to jam them in there. I think \"Respectless\" and \"You Didn't Know\" were some of the only songs that were amazingly placed, as both of these songs made sense with the scene and the events that were going on around it.</p>\n<h6 class=\"align-center\">It felt rushed</h6>\n<p>In my personal opinion the series could have done well with season 1 being split between 2 seasons with extra story added in, with the season finale of season 1 being heaven saying screw you we are killing your people, and season 2 being heaven fighting and being defeated/succeeding over hell. With this, we would have extra content and the story would slow down quite a bit and not feel rushed.</p>\n<h4 class=\"align-center\">The Rating </h4>\n<p>If you were to ask me on my first watch-through of this show, I would have given it a high score because it was very fun to watch and very entertaining, the songs were amazing, and the characters were, and still are loveable. On the surface, I could understand the series as a whole. However, on my 2nd and 3rd watch throughs, I found more issues with the series, and finally, on my final watch-through, my review turned from a high rating to a low rating claiming that a lot of this was more eye candy than creative writing as the story failed to hold up continuity and the pacing was all over the place.</p>",
