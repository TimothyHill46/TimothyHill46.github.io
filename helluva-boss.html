Blitzo got tired of being </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a basic</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> nobody and decided to start his own business.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">what is his business?</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">you might ask, hunting down and killing in any specified way that dammed souls may request/demand, and who do he and his business partners hunt? Humans on Earth!</span></p><h5 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Does Blitzo Get To Earth?</span></h5><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Blitzo does a transaction, for lack of better words, with a powerful demon known as an ars goetia named Stolas. Stolas has a book with magical powers to open portals to the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">human world.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through this book, he is meant to study the stars and understand prophecies.

They even show (tho blurred) dildos in 2 of the episodes. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This series is very crude, more so than Hazbin Hotel</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, so be warned</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p><h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Good</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This series is actually hilarious. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The writing is well done (to a point </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I will get to that), the characters are loveable, and, in a lot of aspects, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> relatable when it comes to their emotional issues. When watching the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">series</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> you get to grow with and watch the characters progress in their emotional state, from the petty drama between Blitzo and Moxxie to the romantic married couple between Moxxie and Milly.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p><h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bad</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right around late season 2, the story got shaky, facing similar issues as to Hazbin Hotel. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mostly</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the questionable pacing of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">characters'</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> emotional status. It is apparent that since the 2nd episode, Stolas did not have a good relationship with his daughter due to family issues. However, in the later episode of season 2, we have a major falling out that is caused by questionable reasons and felt very forced. A few other events took place as well </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> also feels like context is missing or out of order</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, more</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> info on that in my in-depth post (to be added).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I think one of the major flaws with this storyline is that at many points that it feel rushed. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> not nearly as bad as Hazbin Hotel, you start to notice it in episodes like season 1 episode 6 truth seekers. by no means a bad episode, but it felt like the flow could of been smoother as it felt like bits of the story were taken out due to keeping it within the appropriate time limit.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lastly, we have very little Milly growth, now the writers tried to combat that with showing story about her and her family, but even then Milly feels like a flat character, for being one of the major characters in the series she has less growth then the</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> "</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I say, I say!</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">" </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">salesmen.</span></p><h4 class="align-center"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Rating </span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So of all the harshness I gave, this series is unmatched when compared to many other indie series or even standard TV shows</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, I</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> hope the writing gets better </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> this is just time constrained issue that we will not have in the future. As it sits right now, I am giving this series a 7/10. A major step above Hazbin, as it has incredible music and pretty good writing for most of the story. All the music is amazingly placed and works well with the story. I </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">just</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> hope that season 3 does not fall into the same pit holes as </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hazbin</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Hotel.</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on May 15, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/hellaverse/">Hellaverse</a></li><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/quick-read/">Quick Read</a></li><li><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/tags/tv/">TV</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/authors/timothy-hill/" rel="author">Timothy Hill</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/what-are-moba-game.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> What Are MOBA Game?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://timothyhill46.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
